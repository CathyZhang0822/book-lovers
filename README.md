I implemented this web application using Node.JS based on Express framework. Used MySQL as the Database Management System. The application was developed in Cloud 9 and deployed to Heroku. During the deployment process, data was migrated to Heroku using ClearDB addon.

This application provides a clear user interface for users to manipulate the data. The database has 3 tables: users, books and reviews. Users can do CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) operations to those 3 tables easily.
